# Screeps AI
Role-based, polished AI for the programming game Screeps.

## Features
- robust, consistent, and role-based creep behaviour
- extensive prototyping, high-level management code
- polished with many statistics, visuals, and monitoring systems
- high safety and stability, no breaking errors
- well documented and commented, for easy learning and forced rubber ducky effect
- fully mechanically complete: uses all mechanics and systems in the game
- raw Javascript only, no typescript, no libraries, no compilation, no obfuscation, no syntactic sugar

## Documentation

### Spawning
Your first spawn must be placed with a clearance of 5 spaces to it's left, 6 to the top and bottom, and 7 to the right.
This allows for ample room for a base to be built in the first room.

## Visualizer
Each Colony and Expansion will run a visualizer.
The top left has the population broken down by role and assignment.
The bottom has a log of the last 50 tick's CPU usage in the timer log, drawing it as a bar graph.
